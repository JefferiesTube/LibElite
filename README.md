# LibElite
A .NET Library to work with game data and community sources for the game Elite: Dangerous

This was extracted from an older hobby project of mine. It's by far not fully cleaned, it might not work flawlessly and any feedback, help or pull requests are highly appreciated.

I will use this in some projects for the community. If anyone uses it, let me know.
